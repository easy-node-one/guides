  This guide won't work out so well for absolutely new users. You should go through the [New Validator Steps](../pre-installation/new-validator-steps/) and setup a node that way before you attempt the quick version.

## Server Prep

>   * Other Providers Admins: Use the [Any Other Provider Guide](../server-prep/any-other-provider/) on how to edit your [sudoers file](../server-prep/any-other-provider/sudoless-root-access.md) or give access via groups.

>   * Digital Ocean Auto Mounted Volumes will be detected and used for installation storage.
>   * Other Providers: Mount your volume as a folder inside /mnt and it will be detected automatically and used for installation storage.
