# Validator Toolbox Guide by Easy Node
Welcome to the Validator Toolbox Guide by Easy Node Community!
## Getting Started
We created this guide originally in August of 2021. Latest current updates applied 5/4/2022.

> If you're an existing validator, hit the [quick installation guide](/quick-install) and perform the pre-launch setup for your provider.

If this is your very first time running a validator you should start with our original [Harmony Operator Companion Guide](https://companion.easynode.one) and learn all about installing Harmony manually first.
