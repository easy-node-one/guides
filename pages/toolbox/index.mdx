## Getting Started
We created this guide originally in August of 2021. Latest current updates applied 5/4/2022.

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
    If this is your very first time running a validator you should start with our original [Harmony Operator Companion Guide](/companion) and learn all about installing Harmony manually first.
</Callout>

## Usage
Existing validators with solid Harmony Server Setup knowledge can use this guide to install Easy Node's Validator Toolbox for installation & management of Harmony ONE Validator Nodes (regular & full nodes currently).
