# Brand Your Validator
---
## Pick a brand
Now is the time to decide on your brand. Once you're known and people start delegating it's hard to break out after renaming!
> This is the point you will have to stop and determine your brand.
Validators are basically independent corporations that need supporters to cover daily operational costs. It'll always suit you best to come up with a brand name that compliments what you've planned out to add to the community.
> If you've got enough $ONE saved up to buy a slot for yourself, this isn't much concern but if you're going to be relying on the public to back your validator make some solid choices here at this point.
