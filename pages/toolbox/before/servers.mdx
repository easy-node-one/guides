# Server or Provider of Servers
One of the first steps is deciding where to run your servers. The requirements from Harmony are below but beware disk storage expands fast currently and we now suggest using 8+ dedicated CPUs + 850GB for storage on any provider.

## Hardware/Cloud Server Requirements
Review the current [hardware requirements here](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators/server-setup/requirements).

## Hardware Suggestions
    - CPU: 8+ dedicated cores is recommended
    - Memory: 16GB+ recommended
    - Storage: Currently 2TB+ NvME, as of 5.1.2022 database already 800GB+ and growing. Plan for the future.
    - OS: Ubuntu 20.04LTS Linux
    - Network: 1GBPS+ bandwidth, 5~6 TB data usage per month (preferably more if possible)

## Cost
Most providers average around $125/mo per server to have sufficient CPUs and storage for Harmony Validator Software & Databases.

## Self Stake
10001 Harmony $ONE will need to be provided to the wallet you choose to use for your validator when you get to that step in the process.

## Cloud Providers
There's unlimited options on who to rent a server from. We've tried many, we suggest the following if you're looking for a cloud hosted server.
-  Sign up on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/b761e5fdd694) and get $100 for your first 2 months fees - You can sign up before creating servers to lock in your account.
-  [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8873853) - A good option as well for a 2nd server on a different provider for redundancy
-  OVH.us
-  OVH Europe
-  Hetzner

Other Providers, server purchase required to sign up:
-  [OVHCloud ](https://us.ovhcloud.com/) \(USA\) - We use a bare metal server ADV-2 from OVH for our workhorse backbone server, make sure you get 1Gbps speed + or you may have signing issues
-  [OVH.com](https://www.ovh.com/world/) \(Outside USA\) - Several have reported good servers from OVH
-  [Hetzner.com](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) - Several have reported good servers from Hetzner

## Why Digital Ocean
There's many reasons but mostly how easy they are to use, the reliability, the cost, and the free $100 to learn with just for signing up. However, Digital Ocean servers can no longer keep up with the growing demand of resources in Harmony ONE. Consider learning on a Digital Ocean server but finding a Bare Metal Provider before you become elected.

**Benefits of using Digital Ocean:**
-  $100 in free credit. You're gonna need it if you aren't rich.
-  Website is super easy to use to create servers & setup your firewall
-  Volumes
    1. Since Harmony's data size has grown volumes help keep costs down
    2. They can be expanded live, on the fly, without shutting off harmony
    3. Don't spend too much extra cash on storage
