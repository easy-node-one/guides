    New users will want to know how harmony works before using the Validator Toolbox. Please setup a node by hand with the [Harmony Operators Companion Guide](https://companion.easynode.one) before using the toolbox!

## Becoming a Validator
#### The TL;DR overview of becoming a validator at the current time
<dl>
    <dd>Create nodes (servers) to sign blocks for your validator wallet</dd>
    <dd>Create a brand and market it, a lot</dd>
    <dd>Find a way to add to the community, make people know you're helping</dd>
    <dd>Answer questions in the official harmony support channels</dd>
    <dd>Work on getting more delegations, you'll need it</dd>
    <dd>Debate when it's an appropriate time to add a 2nd BLS key to your server (right now it's around 10 million before you look at a 2nd key)</dd>
    <dd>Start new nodes as info and shard conditions change daily</dd>
</dl>
## Setting up a Server Node
#### The TL;DR **on creating nodes (servers)**
<dl>
    <dt>There's really not much to configuring a new harmony node server or rolling out an additional node when needed if you're familiar with Linux and if the following list is familiar to you:</dt>
    <dd>Create cloud server</dd>
    <dd>Create a non-root user account</dd>
    <dd>Create a directory for the install files and database</dd>
    <dd>Download and install hmy & harmony</dd>
    <dd>Setup BLS keys in .hmy/blskeys</dd>
    <dd>Import or create a wallet</dd>
    <dd>Sync Database</dd>
    <dd>Install and start service</dd>
    <dd>Setup [scripts](../../after-node-setup/validator-tools/scripts/) to assist with management</dd>
</dl>
During **Installation** use [our middle section](/official) **along with the official Harmony guide.**
## After Setup Steps
#### The TL;DR on life after you've worked and become elected
<dl>
    <dt>After you're elected and you've worked hard enough to secure enough delegates to become stable here's what the validator life is like daily.</dt>
    <dd>Monitor stats non stop on [Smart Stake's Next Election site](https://harmony.smartstake.io/election)</dd>
    <dd>Monitor stats on your nodes</dd>
    <dd>Monitor uptime (aka missed signings)</dd>
    <dd>Investigate missed signings</dd>
    <dd>Make decisions on adding or removing BLS keys before elections every 18ish hours</dd>
    <dd>Take crap for making any decision</dd>
    <dd>Market your brand some more to get more delegations</dd>
    <dd>Repeat</dd>
</dl>
