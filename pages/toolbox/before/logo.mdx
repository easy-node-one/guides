# Create a Validator Logo - Keybase
Keybase
## Validator Image for Staking Portal
Use Keybase to verify yourself and set an image to be used on the [staking dashboard](https://staking.harmony.one).

Add your brand logo to a keybase account so it's ready for your validator

The official Harmony DOCs has a great guide on this setup. See the [Harmony Official Guide on Logos](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators/managing-a-validator/adding-a-validator-logo)
 
Create your keybase account & upload your logo.
 
Record your ID number for use later when creating your validator.
