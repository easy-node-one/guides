# How to stop worrying and pick a shard
---
## Database Sizes = Shard Choice
> As of 5/1/22 most transactions happen on Shard 0 and it has the largest database size. Every server node deployed always has to have Shard 0, along with the database for Shards 1-3 if you're operating on one of those shards.
## Shard 0
> We encourage single key/slot validators to stay off of shard 0 at the current time as the hardware costs are 2x the cost on shards 1-3 and there's also a higher risk of having data overage costs on shard 0 as we saw in June during the spam attack on validators.
## Picking a Shard
> We suggest looking at the smart stake site and determining which shard of 1-3 has the lowest # of keys and using that shard.
## Changing Shards
> If you grow large enough and want to contribute on Shard 0 later you can simply change keys at an epoch election to switch to new servers on a new shard #.
