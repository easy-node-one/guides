# Launch the validatortoolbox
Now it's installed, how do we start it?
---
## Startup
> If this is the first time the validatortoolbox is run on a brand new node we will install the Harmony ONE Validator Software for you! 
> 
> On the first run on a new or existing node our menu will ask you some questions about your preferences to help build our catalogue.
> 
> To launch the installer or the interface menu simply run:
```text
python3 ~/validatortoolbox/toolbox/start.py
```
