**Start Installer Application**
> Run this option if you are loading a brand new server for the very first time.
**Start Validator Toolbox Menu**
> Run this option if you are loading the toolbox on a server that is already running as a harmony validator node.
## Shard Choice
![Pick a shard, any shard!](/image_39.png)
> Simply pick the shard this node will run on. It's a personal preference, although we suggest looking at the [smart stake site](https://harmony.smartstake.io/election) and determining which shard of 1-3 has the lowest # of keys and using that shard.
## Node Type
![Pick your node type](/image_33.png)
**Standard Signing Node**
> Known to most as a "Harmony Validator" this option loads a wallet and saves your passphrase in ~/harmony/passphrase.txt
**Full Node Non Validating Dev/RPC**
> Choose this option to load a system that doesn't use a wallet. Mostly used by developers and RPC services
## Testnet or Mainnet
![Choose testnet or mainnet for your server](/image_34.png)
**Mainnet**
> The main Harmony ONE Blockchain for normal operations.
**Testnet**
> The Harmony ONE Testnet, use with test tokens. You can [visit our discord community](https://discord.gg/babnYCEZ7Q) if you need test network coins, we have plenty.
## Express Install or Manual Choices
![Express or Manual?](/image_41.png)

## Recover Wallet \(Regular Signing Validator Nodes Only\)

> Add your mnemonic phrase here directly into the hmy file interface. We do not store or save this information.
**New Users** - If you do not have a wallet yet, press ctrl+c to skip wallet recovery and after installation you can manually create or import a wallet of your choosing.
## Clone Shards
You will now start cloning your shards. If you choose shard 1-3 that shard will download before shard 0. You can press ctrl+c to cancel downloading of any shard to move past that download.

## Install completed!
