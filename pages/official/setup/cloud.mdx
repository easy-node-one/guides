If your provider has a guide to get your server online you'll find it here.
## OVH & OVH.us
We currently run a bare metal advanced-2 server from OVH.us for our 2nd and testing node. You get quite the discount for pre-paying for a year of service. Worth looking into if you are on a budget but requires some manual setup of things as you are the full administrator of an empty server to start.  
> **Warning:** AWS, Google & Microsoft will probably cost you far more than you will make at this point.
