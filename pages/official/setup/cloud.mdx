If your provider has a guide to get your server online you'll find it here.

## OVH & OVH.us
We currently run a bare metal advanced-2 server from OVH.us for our 2nd and testing node. You get quite the discount for pre-paying for a year of service. Worth looking into if you are on a budget but requires some manual setup of things as you are the full administrator of an empty server to start.

<b>Warning:</b> AWS, Google and Microsoft are not affordable at this point. Digital Ocean shared VPS no longer an option either. Bare Metal Providers are suggested.
