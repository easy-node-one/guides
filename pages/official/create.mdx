# Creating a Validator
Before you can create a validator on the blockchain you need a fresh wallet to use for your validator account.

## Creating a new validator wallet
This section will walk you through making a brand new wallet. If that's what you'd like to do you can follow that. 

#### Option B: Using an existing wallet instead
<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
You can also import an existing wallet in a variety of ways. Take a look at the output of the command `./hmy keys` below to see your options.
</Callout>
```text
./hmy keys
Manage your local keys

Usage:
  hmy keys [flags]
  hmy keys [command]

Available Commands:
  add                   Create a new keystore key
  check-passphrase      Check if passphrase for given account is valid.
  export-ks             Export the keystore file contents
  export-private-key    Export the secp256k1 private key
  generate-bls-key      Generate bls keys then encrypt and save the private key with a requested passphrase
  generate-bls-keys     Generates multiple bls keys for a given shard network configuration and then encrypts and saves the private key with a requested passphrase
  get-public-bls-key    Get the public bls key associated with the provided private bls key
  import-ks             Import an existing keystore key
  import-private-key    Import an existing keystore key (only accept secp256k1 private keys)
  list                  List all the local accounts
  location              Show where `hmy` keeps accounts & their keys
  mnemonic              Compute the bip39 mnemonic for some input entropy
  recover-bls-key       Recover bls keys from an encrypted bls key file
  recover-from-mnemonic Recover account from mnemonic
  remove                Remove a key from the keystore
  save-bls-key          Encrypt and save the bls private key with a requested passphrase

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for keys

Global Flags:
      --file string   Path to file for given command when applicable
  -e, --ledger        Use ledger hardware wallet
      --no-latest     Do not add 'latest' to RPC params
      --no-pretty     Disable pretty print JSON outputs
  -n, --node string   <host> (default "http://localhost:9500")
  -v, --verbose       dump out debug information, same as env var HMY_ALL_DEBUG=true

Use "hmy keys [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

For example, if you'd like to recover your wallet from a mnemonic phrase, run the following command.

```text
./hmy keys recover-from-mnemonic [myUserAccount] --passphrase
```

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
  Add your linux user account name in place of [myUserAccount] - We use serviceharmony as our user name.
</Callout>

You can also replace recover-from-mnemonic with the importing option of your choice on the list above.

After you've created a wallet or imported an existing wallet successfully you can view your registered validator wallet address with the following command.

```text
./hmy keys list
```
## Creating a Validator
Here's the example command given in the office guide below. I'll suggest some updates and give an example command in the following steps.

### Mainnet
```bash
./hmy --node="https://api.s0.t.hmny.io" staking create-validator \
    --validator-addr [ONE ADDRESS] --amount 10000 \
    --bls-pubkeys [BLS PUBLIC KEY1],[BLS PUBLIC KEY2] \
    --name "[NAME]" --identity "[IDENTITY]" --details "DETAILS" \
    --security-contact "CONTACT" --website "YOUR-WEBSITE.COM" \
    --max-change-rate 0.1 --max-rate 0.1 --rate 0.1 \
    --max-total-delegation 100000000 --min-self-delegation 10000 --passphrase
```

### Testnet
```bash
./hmy --node="https://api.s0.b.hmny.io" staking create-validator \
    --validator-addr [ONE ADDRESS] --amount 10000 \
    --bls-pubkeys [BLS PUBLIC KEY1],[BLS PUBLIC KEY2] \
    --name "[NAME]" --identity "[IDENTITY]" --details "DETAILS" \
    --security-contact "CONTACT" --website "YOUR-WEBSITE.COM" \
    --max-change-rate 0.1 --max-rate 0.1 --rate 0.1 \
    --max-total-delegation 100000000 --min-self-delegation 10000 --passphrase
```
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Copy the entire command. **Extra white spaces in the command could cause errors.**
  Name, identity, details, security-contact and website need to be put in double quotes if there are more than one word separated by space (example --name "John the validator").
</Callout>
</div>

#### Our suggestions
You will want to setup your logo for the validator. [Here's the Adding A Validator Logo](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators/managing-a-validator/adding-a-validator-logo) section of the official guide that will get you set up with an identity string. We suggest including the identity string in your create-validator command.

With that in mind, the only extra item we suggest to include is the --identity information. Here's an example with a fake address and information as an example.

##### Example on Mainnet w/ 1 BLS key
```bash
./hmy --node="https://api.s0.t.hmny.io" staking create-validator \
    --validator-addr one1rka0v5rct0857f2f*6ahn0cyd89uvravr3yjw --amount 10000 \
    --bls-pubkeys a243b3a090063bae6aeca9215*05de1a94a033c50ab98ed98c50ab98ed984c9cf23513585e1af0cc4c9cf23513585e1af0cc \
    --name "My Awesome Validator" --identity 05de1a94a0*33c50ab98ed98 --details "All your validator notes that show up on the staking.harmony.one site" \
    --security-contact "myemail@address.com" --website "your-website.com" \
    --max-change-rate 0.1 --max-rate 0.1 --rate 0.1 \
    --max-total-delegation 100000000 --min-self-delegation 10000 --passphrase
```
<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  Copy the entire command above and edit it yourself. Extra white spaces in the command could cause errors.
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  Decide on your max-change-rate and max-rate before sending your command. These cannot be modified once created.
