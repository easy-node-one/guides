# Software Setup
Read our docs first, then fight through the official documentation!
## Original Software Setup Guide
Match the next 4 sections up with the [official Harmony ONE guide](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators) when setting up your validator. Read our notes first to help you cut out a lot of the junk that the official documents contain.
- [Node Setup](/official/node) Matches up with the Node Setup section in the official docs.
- [Cloud Setup](/official/cloud) Matches up with the Cloud Setup section in the official docs.
- [Creating A Validator](/official/create) Matches up with the Creating A Validator section in the official docs.
- [Managing A Validator](/official/manage) Matches up with the Manage A Validator section in the official docs.
## The Easy Node Way
We suggest setting up your node "The Easy Node Way!!!"
-  Setup a user account to run harmony
  -  Don't use root or harmony as account names!!!
  -  We suggest your username as something like serviceharmony which will be included in "The Slugom Way!!!"
-  Use a folder in your user home directory to store harmony
  -  We suggest /home/serviceharmony/harmony
