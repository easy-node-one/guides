## Storage
Before we talk about providers let's discuss storage. Make sure you have enough space as we're currently adding over 300GB a month due to transaction increases.

Digital Ocean has the option to use "Volumes" that can be [easily expanded](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/volumes/how-to/increase-size/) when more space is required to help with cost savings.
# Cloud Server Providers
## Digital Ocean
We use [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/b761e5fdd694). You're free to use anyone you'd like but our guide is written for **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on Digital Ocean** although it may work just fine with any Ubuntu release or provider.
> Here are the suggested node requirements as of 9/12/2021:

## Our only referrals in this guide - Get $100 Free off Server Fees on either provider!
If you sign up with [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/b761e5fdd694) or [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8873853) using our links you'll get $100 in credit towards your future server fees.
> You can try other providers but they will cost you a lot more. We hear Vultr is good but haven't investigated them or their setup yet.
## OVH & OVH.us
We currently run a bare metal advanced-2 server from OVH.us for our 2nd and testing node. You get quite the discount for pre-paying for a year of service. Worth looking into if you are on a budget but requires some manual setup of things as you are the full administrator of an empty server to start.  
> **Warning:** AWS, Google & Microsoft will probably cost you far more than you will make at this point.
