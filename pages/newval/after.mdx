#### What to expect after becoming a validator

# After setting up nodes

For the server admin they can expect to use the hmy application and edit-validator command a lot. You'll use it to update your name, website, details, keys and more.

Most of the stuff you do while setting up a node is only done while setting up a node and you only need to know how to perform those steps while setting up a new server.

Here's a few things we'll cover after the validator guide notes. You can skip to these if you're already a node operator.
