# Node Cheat Sheet - Quick Setup Guide

We suggest building a text document you can use to easily setup a node. You'll want to use an editor that does plain text and not formatted html as it can mess up your saved commands.

We suggest using a github repo to save a markdown file to use for your commands.

* Create a [github](https://github.com) repo
* Create a [markdown file ](https://markdown-editor.github.io/)with your commands
* Update your sheets as needed
