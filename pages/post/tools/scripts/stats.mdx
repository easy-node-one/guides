# Current Stats Script
Get your stats here! Here's a simple script to poll your node and the blockchain.
## How do I see what block we're on?
Use the commands below to download and setup a file called stats.sh in your harmony directory. Pick the tab for the shard you're on.

Shard 0:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easy-node-one/harmony-validator-scripts/main/stats/shard_0.sh && mv shard_0.sh stats.sh && chmod +x stats.sh
```

Shard 1
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easy-node-one/harmony-validator-scripts/main/stats/shard_1.sh && mv shard_1.sh stats.sh && chmod +x stats.sh
```

Shard 2
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easy-node-one/harmony-validator-scripts/main/stats/shard_2.sh && mv shard_2.sh stats.sh && chmod +x stats.sh
```

Shard 3
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easy-node-one/harmony-validator-scripts/main/stats/shard_3.sh && mv shard_3.sh stats.sh && chmod +x stats.sh
```

After downloading the file you can use vi, vim or nano to edit your stats.sh file and change the "**My Node**" label to whatever you would like, you're the admin, customize away!

Now that it's set up you can run it anytime with:

```bash
./stats.sh
```

Here's an example of Shard 3 in sync via the output of ./stats.sh

Here's the breakdown of the output:

- First line is a simple print of the date & time
- **My Validator Node** - This is your nodes information. 
  - Top line is shard 0 bottom is shard 3 in this example.
- **External Harmony Node** - This is the blockchain information. 
  - Top line is shard 0 bottom is shard 3 in this example.
  - Verify My Validator Node #'s match External Harmony Node for Sync status
- **Uptime** - Your node information: how long it's been booted up, # of users, cpu load average - lower means less resources in use
- **Harmony DB Size** - A print out of the size of your databases noted with name to the right of each.
- **Harmony Version** - A print out of the current version of your harmony application
