# "Backup" Node
Our notes on running a 2nd server for redundancy
## Backup Server
A backup node is no longer recommended by Harmony. Please discontinue having duplicate nodes when possible. You can still have a 2nd server ready to take over but running dual nodes will be disallowed soon.

    <p>We recommend keeping your nodes as close to the west coast of USA as possible as this is where Harmony runs most servers currently.</p>

### So you're going to do it anyways
## Backup Server Setup
Run another server using the same .key & .pass files as the first
To run a backup node complete the same setup with the following changes:
- Import your wallet instead of creating one.
- Copy your key and pass files over from your other server
