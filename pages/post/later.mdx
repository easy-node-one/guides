You can view pending and submit items to our issues board located on the [github repository](https://github.com/easy-node-one/validatortoolbox/issues). 

### Here's a few of our favorites

#### Supercharged Data
We're going to start utilizing the full API to pull better stats data for option #1.

#### BLS Keys
BLS Key management is complex and we're not sure if it can be coded in at this point without liability but we'll be proposing this as a project soon!

Create, Add, Remove, although we'll have to add a lot of annoying messages about backing them up to your home machine.

#### Web Integration
Investigating the use of an internal web server for private control of your node. Would need to be secured and protected but this is a possible feature we'll be adding down the road!
