If you already have a validator setup and landed here there's only a few notes to keep in mind when adapting these to your setup:

* Our guide is **not for clicking and pasting commands without understanding and modifying the commands first** 
* Our guide is for **Ubuntu Linux 18.04LTS/20.04LTS** focused on **Digital Ocean Droplets \(Virtual Servers\)**
* Our guide encourages people to **set up a user account** to run their service from
* Our guide encourages people to **use ~/harmony** for their setup and scripts
* _**Use these commands at your own risk after reviewing and modifying them for your environment.**_
