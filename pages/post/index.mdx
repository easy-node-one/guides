- Our guide is **not for clicking and pasting commands without understanding and modifying the commands first*- 
- Our guide encourages people to **set up a user account** to run their service from
- Our guide encourages people to **use ~/harmony** for their setup and scripts
- _**Use these commands at your own risk after reviewing and modifying them for your environment.**_
