## What is a Findora Validator?
Like most EVM type validators, Findora validators are responsible for processing the blocks. The validator who proposes the block on Findora gets the reward. Here's some differences for those familiar with Harmony ONE:
- 21 day unstaking (but you continue to earn while unstaking!)
- .3 Findora fee for each missed block shared by your entire delegation pool
- 5% slashing fee on your entire delegation pool for double Signing
- After initial stake no minimum to add more


## Getting Findora
Currently the easiest way to obtain Findora is via [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=rJSJQQV). Here's the steps you'll need to complete to get Findora staked:

## The Easy Node Way
When using our guides or tips you can always assume the following things that aren't really specified in the Harmony Documents. We call this "The Easy Node Way" which helps with organization and security:

-  Setup a user account to run docker & findora
    -  Don't use `root` or `findora` as account names!!!
    -  We suggest your username as something like `servicefindora`
