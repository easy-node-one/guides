# Harmony ONE Documents Companion Guide by Easy Node Community
Welcome to Easy Node Community's Companion guide. Here we cover what it takes to become a Validator on Harmony ONE and what you can expect along the journey.
## Getting Started
> We created this guide originally in March of 2021. Latest current updates applied 5/4/2022.
<Image src="/image_17.png" alt="Harmony Logo" width={418} height={121} />
> While [the Official Harmony $ONE Validator guide](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators) is quite amazing and helpful, there are some gaps left that may leave some new administrators with questions. We'll tackle all those and more here.
## Usage
This guide is divided into 3 sections:
- Top Section: What to expect before becoming a validator
- Mid Section: Matches up to the official harmony document website section for section. We give you notes to know before you tackle the official documents that contain far too much information for other scenarios.
- Bottom Section: Post install, what to do and what to expect.

## What is a Harmony Validator?
Technically a _**validator**_ lives on the blockchain \(For Harmony Validators it's simply a Harmony Wallet of your choice that you would like to use as your public Validator Address which we mark on the blockchain as a "validator"\) and the _**nodes**_ \(The Linux Servers that verify & sign blocks\) sign the transaction blocks on behalf of the validator's wallet.
> Here we focus on building and running the nodes but we'll also use commands to setup and manage the validator along the way.
