Welcome to Easy Node Community's Documentation site.

#### What is a Harmony Validator?
Technically a _**validator**_ lives on the blockchain \(For Harmony Validators it's simply a Harmony Wallet of your choice that you would like to use as your public Validator Address which we mark on the blockchain as a "validator"\) and the _**nodes**_ \(The Linux Servers that verify & sign blocks\) sign the transaction blocks on behalf of the validator's wallet.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
Here we focus on building and running the nodes but we'll also use commands to setup and manage the validator along the way.

## Getting Started
How to use the Easy Node Documentation Portal

We started our first guide for Harmony ONE Validators in March 2021. We've combined all of our documentation into one site as of May 2022.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
While [the Official Harmony $ONE Validator guide](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators) is quite amazing and helpful, there are some gaps left that may leave some new administrators with questions. We'll tackle all those and more here.

Here's a little more info on the next two sections.

## New Validators
This section is our original guide has morphed into our [New Validators](/companion) Guide. 

Learning everything by hand is necessary as there is no support or warranty when you run into issues on the blockchain!

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
    We highly suggest new validators manually install their first server software setup before using our `validatortoolbox` application!
</Callout>

## Existing Validators
This section is our [Validator Toolbox](/toolbox) Guide and has you covered to help you out with our Installer & Manage Menu application. 

If you're a returning visitor you probably want the [Quick Install](/toolbox/quick-install) instructions.

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
    New Validators can take a look at our installer, but please, learn how to do it by hand first!
