# Harmony ONE Protocol Guides by Easy Node Community
Welcome to Easy Node Community's Documentation site.

#### What is a Harmony Validator?
Technically a _**validator**_ lives on the blockchain \(For Harmony Validators it's simply a Harmony Wallet of your choice that you would like to use as your public Validator Address which we mark on the blockchain as a "validator"\) and the _**nodes**_ \(The Linux Servers that verify & sign blocks\) sign the transaction blocks on behalf of the validator's wallet.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
Here we focus on building and running the nodes but we'll also use commands to setup and manage the validator along the way.
</Callout>

#### Getting Started
We started our first guide for Harmony ONE Validators in March 2021. We've combined all of our documentation into one site as of May 2022.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
While [the Official Harmony $ONE Validator guide](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators) is quite amazing and helpful, there are some gaps left that may leave some new administrators with questions. We'll tackle all those and more here.

## Usage
#### New Validators
Our original guide has morphed into our guide for [New Validators](/companion). Learning everything by hand is necessary as there is no support or warranty when you run into issues on the blockchain!

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
    We highly suggest new validators manually install their first server software setup before using our `validatortoolbox` application!
</Callout>

#### Existing Validators
Our [Validator Toolbox Guide](/toolbox) has you covered to help you out with our Installer & Manage Menu application. If you're a returning visitor you probably want the [Quick Install](/toolbox/quick-install) instructions.

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
    New Validators can take a look at our installer, but please, learn how to do it by hand first!
