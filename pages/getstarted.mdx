# Get Started
In this subsection we will break down each page of the guide and give our notes on each page
### When & How to use our Companion Guide
## New Validators
If you're just getting started with setting up a validator node, you will want to open the [Official Harmony Validator Guide](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators) and then start on the section that matches our [Software Setup](/official/setup) section to the page of the same name in the official harmony documentation.
> We suggest reading our notes on their sections, then going through that section of the official guide so you know what to look out for before you read through too much information.
> 
> **Update 9/20/2021: Use our new** [**Validator Toolbox Installer**](https://validator-toolbox-guide.easynode.one/) **& Management Application to simplify your node setup and management!**
## Existing Validators
If you're an existing validator you're probably mostly interested in our Post Node Install section at the end of our guide. Keep in mind the notes in the section below. We encourage people reading our guide to consider using a separate Linux user for the service and using a ~/harmony folder for storing the application.
