# Get Started
In this subsection we will break down each page of the guide and give our notes on each page
### When & How to use our Companion Guide
## New Validators
If you're just getting started with setting up a validator node, you will want to open the [Official Harmony Validator Guide](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators) and then start on the section that matches our [Software Setup](/official/setup) section to the page of the same name in the official harmony documentation.
> We suggest reading our notes on their sections, then going through that section of the official guide so you know what to look out for before you read through too much information.
## Existing Validators
If you're an existing validator you're probably mostly interested in our [Post Install Tips](/post) section at the end of our guide. If you're looking for the Easy Node Validator Toolbox to help you setup another node or manage them, you can find that [here](https://validator-toolbox-guide.easynode.one).
### Copy & Pasting Commands From Our Guide
If you're here for an easy setup you won't find one. This guide will help teach you how to administrate your Linux servers.    
- Our guide is **not for clicking and pasting** commands without **understanding** and **modifying** the commands first
- Our guide is for **Ubuntu Linux 18.04LTS/20.04LTS** focused on **Digital Ocean Droplets \(Virtual Servers\)**
- Our guide encourages people to **set up a user account** to run their service from
