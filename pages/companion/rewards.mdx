Our tips on rewards for stakers and validators

## Rewards as a Delegator
Usually one of the first things to come up in chat is "When will I get rewarded?" and we can cover that here as well. You've hit Delegate and signed over $ONE to be used on a validator, great! Now you want to know when you'll get paid.

* You will get rewards in real time when the next epoch starts
* You can claim your rewards at anytime
* You can compound your rewards once you have 1000 $ONE, the minimum to delegate

## Rewards as a Validator

Validator rewards are earned along side the delegator rewards. The fee is deducted at the same time \(if there is a fee on your validator\) and has already been removed from your coins available to claim.
