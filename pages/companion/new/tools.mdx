# Administrator Tools
Here's some helpful free tools you can setup to use to work with your nodes before you get started.
## Termius
Available for Windows, Mac, Mobile - Amazing application worth the fee to use on the go. Available [here](https://termius.com).
<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
All the screenshots for Moba translate to work in the same way on Termius.
</Callout>
## Mobaxterm
Available for Windows users, [Mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html) - Another SSH client for easier management of your nodes.
### Usage
Once you've loaded the application, create a new "Sessions" connection.

Replace your node IP in the "Remote host" and change the username if needed. This is the initial setup we suggest for connecting to a newly created server node.

After you've gone through our guide, setup a user account and have a folder made for your application you can change your connection to reflect these settings. Replace the username with the username you use to run your harmony application.

With your SSH-browser type set to SCP you'll also get a WinSCP style window to copy files to your node while you're viewing it in terminal.
<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
You can also load up multiple terminals, run htop or other statistics and commands simultaneously. 
</Callout>
## VS Code 
This [application for Windows or Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the text editor we use to remotely change the files on our nodes. Connects to your droplet via the same SSH key public/private pair you'll create for your user account.
<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
Once you've downloaded and installed the application we recommend going to their Extensions section \(CTRL+SHIFT+F\) and installing the Remote Development Extension Pack.
</Callout>

Configure your server, user account and IdentityFile in your SSH configuration file for VS Code.

## Other Windows Utility Applications
    - [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu-2004-lts/9n6svws3rx71?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) - If you're running Windows 10, go to the Microsoft Store and install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. It's super helpful to use since your nodes will be Linux anyways.  
    - [Putty ](https://www.putty.org/)- Connection manager and key generator for SSH connections  
    - [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) - Import connections from putty and transfer files with an explorer style interface
## Mac
Mac devs shouldn't really need many extra tools but I don't develop from one myself. If someone wants to add some tools for Mac users and links we'll post credit to your validator!
## Linux Apps & Scripts
Here's our recommendation for additional tools you can load onto your harmony validator node server:

**htop** - Monitor your cpu, memory, service and application stats. Install if missing on ubuntu with:

```bash
sudo apt install htop -y
```

**nethogs** - Monitor your network stats. Install if missing on ubuntu with:

```bash
sudo apt install nethogs -y
```

[Our Administrator Scripts](/post/new/tools/scripts/) - We have a script to pull your stats neatly and a script to upgrade your harmony client when needed. Modify them to fit your configuration.
