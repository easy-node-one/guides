# Being A Validator!

## Update 9/20/2021 - Validator Toolbox by Easy Node Released!

**Our Validator Toolbox Installer is now ready to help you setup a node faster! Read the** [**New Users section**](https://validator-toolbox-guide.easynode.one/full-manual/pre-installation-information/new-validator-steps) **before you get started with the installation application!   
  
We're leaving this guide as is as the information is still super useful but the toolbox can help reduce your setup & management learning curve!**

## Guide Purpose

This guide is going to lightly touch on best practices for running a Harmony ONE Validator Node server. Before we get into that let's discuss what you need to know before you start a validator and what to expect after making it through installing the software.

If you've got over 10 million $ONE you probably don't need to worry about much of the following. If you don't have that much to get started, read on!

## Being a Validator

### TL;DR overview of becoming a validator at the current time

* Create nodes \(servers\) to sign blocks for your validator wallet
* Create a brand and market it, a lot
* Find a way to add to the community, make people know you're helping
* Answer questions in the official harmony support channels
* Work on getting more delegations, you'll need it
* Debate when it's an appropriate time to add a 2nd BLS key to your server \(right now it's around 10 million before you look at a 2nd key\)
* Start new nodes as info and shard conditions change daily

### TL;DR **on creating nodes \(servers\)**

There's really not much to configuring a new harmony node server or rolling out an additional node when needed if you're familiar with Linux and if the following list is familiar to you:

* Create cloud server
* Create a non-root user account
* Create a directory for the install files and database
* Download and install hmy & harmony
* Setup BLS keys in .hmy/blskeys
* Import or create a wallet
* Sync Database
* Install and start service
* Setup [scripts](../../after-node-setup/validator-tools/scripts/) to assist with management

**During Install use** [**our middle section**](../../validator-guide-notes/hardware-requirements/linux-node-setup/) **along with the official Harmony guide.**

### TL;DR on life after you've worked and become elected

After you're elected and you've worked hard enough to secure enough delegates to become stable here's what the validator life is like daily.

* Monitor stats non stop on [Smart Stake's Next Election site](https://harmony.smartstake.io/election)
* Monitor stats on your nodes
* Monitor uptime \(aka missed signings\)
* Investigate missed signings
* Make decisions on adding or removing BLS keys before elections every 18ish hours
* Take crap for making any decision
* Market your brand some more to get more delegations
* Repeat
