# Being A Validator
What it's like to be a validator on Harmony ONE!
## Becoming a Validator
- The TL;DR overview of becoming a validator at the current time
* Create nodes \(servers\) to sign blocks for your validator wallet
* Create a brand and market it, a lot
* Find a way to add to the community, make people know you're helping
* Answer questions in the official harmony support channels
* Work on getting more delegations, you'll need it
* Debate when it's an appropriate time to add a 2nd BLS key to your server \(right now it's around 10 million before you look at a 2nd key\)
* Start new nodes as info and shard conditions change daily
### Setting up a Server Node
- The TL;DR **on creating nodes \(servers\)**
There's really not much to configuring a new harmony node server or rolling out an additional node when needed if you're familiar with Linux and if the following list is familiar to you:
* Create cloud server
* Create a non-root user account
* Create a directory for the install files and database
* Download and install hmy & harmony
* Setup BLS keys in .hmy/blskeys
* Import or create a wallet
* Sync Database
* Install and start service
* Setup [scripts](../../after-node-setup/validator-tools/scripts/) to assist with management
During **Installation** use [**our middle section**](/official) **along with the official Harmony guide.**
### After Setup Steps
- The TL;DR on life after you've worked and become elected
After you're elected and you've worked hard enough to secure enough delegates to become stable here's what the validator life is like daily.
* Monitor stats non stop on [Smart Stake's Next Election site](https://harmony.smartstake.io/election)
* Monitor stats on your nodes
* Monitor uptime \(aka missed signings\)
* Investigate missed signings
* Make decisions on adding or removing BLS keys before elections every 18ish hours
* Take crap for making any decision
* Market your brand some more to get more delegations
* Repeat
