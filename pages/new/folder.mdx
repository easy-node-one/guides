# Create a Harmony folder
We suggest creating a folder named harmony inside of your user account to store your files and database.
---
## Login as regular user
Once you are logged into your new regular user account, create a harmony directory inside the home directory of the new user with the following command:
```bash
mkdir ~/harmony
```
Every time you reconnect you'll have to change directory to your harmony folder. If you ever are "lost" after moving around and need to get back to the harmony folder type the following command:
```bash
cd ~/harmony
```
When you connect or want to run commands, use the command above to get back to that folder. You'll want to run all of your installation commands and validator commands from this folder.
