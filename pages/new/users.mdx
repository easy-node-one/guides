# Create A User Account
How to create a regular user account
## Make a regular user account
Since there are many versions of Linux we won't cover this in depth but here's what you'll need to do:
- never run as `root`
- Make a regular user account
- Setup SSH key pairs for login
- We suggest using [Putty ](../admin-tools.md#linux)to connect to your servers terminal
- We suggest using [WinSCP](../admin-tools.md#windows-applications) for file transfers the easy way on windows
- If you have problems google how to make a user account and how to give it root access for your provider or operating system as that has too many variables to cover.
- We suggest using the name \`**serviceharmony**\` or something similar for your account to keep it unique. The official guide suggests \`**harmony**\` but that can lead to confusion having your account named the same as the folder it's in and having an app of the same name.
