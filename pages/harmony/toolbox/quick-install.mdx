<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  This guide won't work out so well for absolutely new users. You should go through the [New Validator Companion Guide](/harmony/companion) and setup a node manually before you attempt the quick version.

## Server Prep
For full details on how to prep your first server from your provider, see our [Server Prep](/harmony/toolbox/prep/digitalocean) section first.
- ✔️ A new Ubuntu 20.04LTS server
  - ✔️ Login as a user account with sudoless root access or run and install as root
    -Digital Ocean Admins: Use the [User Data](/harmony/toolbox/prep/digitalocean#user-data) section from our main guide to do this automatically!
    -Other Providers Admins: Use the [Any Other Provider Guide](/harmony/toolbox/prep/others) on how to edit your [sudoers file](/harmony/toolbox/prep/others#sudoless-root-access-setup) or give access via groups.
  - ✔️ Volume Support
    -If you have one large disk, you're good to go.
    -Digital Ocean Auto Mounted Volumes will be detected and used for installation storage.
    -Other Providers: Mount your volume as a folder inside /mnt and it will be detected automatically and used for installation storage.

That's it for the requirements, you're ready to connect to your new server and install the Harmony Validator Server Node software.
