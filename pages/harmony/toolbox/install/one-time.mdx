# First Time Validator Extra Steps
The next 3 sections need to be completed **after running the toolbox installer** but before running the management menu application. Since you're an experienced validator you should have already completed everything in this guide. I've left this for new people who may be attempting to "jump the line".

## Create A Wallet
See our notes on [setting up a wallet here](/harmony/companion/new/wallet) if you made it this far without one.

## BLS Keys
See our notes on [creating BLS Keys here](/harmony/companion/new/blskeys) but if you are this far you should already have these.
- Backup (transfer/save) your .key & .pass files onto your home system for re-use in the future
- New keys can be created at anytime and added to your validator for use after the next election
- BLSKeys are hard coded to the shard you create them for, this cannot be changed

## Creating a Validator
You should already have this done as well, but if not, here's our guide on [sending your create-validator command]()

Here's the example command given in the office guide below. I'll suggest some updates and give an example command in the following steps.

`Mainnet`

```bash
./hmy --node="https://api.s0.t.hmny.io" staking create-validator \
    --validator-addr [ONE ADDRESS] --amount 10000 \
    --bls-pubkeys [BLS PUBLIC KEY1],[BLS PUBLIC KEY2] \
    --name "[NAME]" --identity "[IDENTITY]" --details "DETAILS" \
    --security-contact "CONTACT" --website "YOUR-WEBSITE.COM" \
    --max-change-rate 0.1 --max-rate 0.1 --rate 0.1 \
    --max-total-delegation 100000000 --min-self-delegation 10000 --passphrase --gas-price 30
```

`Testnet`

```bash
./hmy --node="https://api.s0.b.hmny.io" staking create-validator \
    --validator-addr [ONE ADDRESS] --amount 10000 \
    --bls-pubkeys [BLS PUBLIC KEY1],[BLS PUBLIC KEY2] \
    --name "[NAME]" --identity "[IDENTITY]" --details "DETAILS" \
    --security-contact "CONTACT" --website "YOUR-WEBSITE.COM" \
    --max-change-rate 0.1 --max-rate 0.1 --rate 0.1 \
    --max-total-delegation 100000000 --min-self-delegation 10000 --passphrase --gas-price 30
```

**Copy the entire command. Extra white spaces in the command could cause errors.**

Name, identity, details, security-contact and website need to be put in double quotes if there are more than one word separated by space \(example --name "John the validator"\).

## Our suggestions
You want to setup your logo for the validator. [Here's the Adding A Validator Logo](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators/managing-a-validator/adding-a-validator-logo) section of the official guide that will get you set up with an identity string. We suggest including the identity string in your create-validator command.
 
With that in mind, the only extra item we suggest to include is the --identity information. Here's an example with a fake address and information as an example.

```bash
./hmy --node="https://api.s0.t.hmny.io" staking create-validator \
    --validator-addr one1rka0v5rct0857f2f*6ahn0cyd89uvravr3yjw --amount 10000 \
    --bls-pubkeys a243b3a090063bae6aeca9215*05de1a94a033c50ab98ed98c50ab98ed984c9cf23513585e1af0cc4c9cf23513585e1af0cc \
    --name "My Awesome Validator" --identity 05de1a94a0*33c50ab98ed98 --details "All your validator notes that show up on the staking.harmony.one site" \
    --security-contact "myemail@address.com" --website "your-website.com" \
    --max-change-rate 0.1 --max-rate 0.1 --rate 0.1 \
    --max-total-delegation 100000000 --min-self-delegation 10000 --passphrase --gas-price 30
```

## All of the options explained
**Decide on your max-change-rate & max-rate before sending your command. These cannot be modified once created.**
    - validator-addr - Your Validator wallet with 10001+ coins available to delegate at least 10k.

    - **max-rate** - Maximum rate you can charge as a fee on your validator  
    - rate - Your current fee rate  
    - max-total-delegation - The max $ONE that can be delegated by one single wallet  
    - min-self-delegation - Must be at least 10k, you can leave this at 10k.
